    "# US 1.1 UV-index Predictor\n",
    "This notebook uses historical Australian UV-data available through ARAPANSA to predict the UV-index for the next 24 hours. The data is used to train a simple linear regression model, which is then used to predict the UV-index for the next 24 hours. The model is trained on the UV-index data from 2007-2021 and tested on the data from 2022. The model is then used to predict the UV-index for the next 24 hours."
